Implement Laravel - In a right way
=================================

After reading [Implement Laravel](https://github.com/tucq88/implement-laravel.git) book, I'm totally inspired and feeling bad at the same time. I'm bored because all my Laravel implementations seem wrong (or not very correct), and I'm happy because I have found a truly-good-way to working with Laravel : For scaling, testing and team working. 
This is my personal implementation based on what I have learnt from the book.
